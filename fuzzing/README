The files are organized as follow:
- The bin folder contains the binary files instrumented by afl-gcc
- The data folder contains the input files that will be used as input from afl-fuzz
- The start.sh script will create an afl folder containing two subfolders:
        - in -> containing 1 subfolder per fuzzer with input files
        - out -> containing 1 subfolder per fuzzer with the output and results

The new script is structured as follow:
  	
	./start.sh Options [binParameters]
	 
	 -c Number of cores 
	 -b path to binary 
	 -d path to data file 
	 -a afl options (right now only "-Q") 
 	 -r to resume the run 
 	binParameters are the parameters needed by the binary beeing fuzzed

For example to run with 4 cores on the latest stratux build:

   ./start.sh -c 4 -b bin/dump1090-cbf122f-stratux-latest -d data/1090_small.bin -- "--no-crc-check --ifile @@"
   
   for a non instumented binary use -a "-Q" to make afl run in QEMU mode
   if you want to resume  a previous run just use the same command as a normal run but with the -r option 
   
The utility afl-whatsup can be used to get information about the running fuzzers with:
  afl-whatsup afl/out/*afl_instance*

**The 1090_smaller.bin file is a even smaller and stripped version of 1090_small.bin it contains just 1 message ( the 1090_small contains the same message but also some others with bad crc) and is significantly smaller than the previous one.
