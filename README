## Generic info

To extract the precompiled dump1090 form the stratux images it is usually located in /usr/lib/fr24
Usually the image should be mountable without problem using the mount command, if it doesn't work try:
  - fdisk -l image.img

  - find the offset of the interesting partition (start_block*sector_size)

  - sudo mount -o loop,offset=*offset* image.img /mnt
  - (sudo mount -o loop,offset=62914560 stratux-v.0.1-08072015.img /mnt)

The file "dump1090-080715-prec" inculded in fuzzing/afl-unicorn is extracted form the first image of stratux ("stratux-v.0.1-080772015.img")
